# Partshell

Partshell is a Vim plugin that provides helper commands for working with shell commands.



## `Shar[gs][!]`

Populates the argument list with the result of a shell command. Each line is interpreted as a path to a file. A NULL byte terminates input.

### Example

`Shargs fd partshell`

### Closest Built-In Command

`args \`fd partshell\`` (but this won't handle matches with spaces in their names properly).

## `Shgr[ep][!]`

## `Shmak[e][!]`

## `Shlmak[e][!]`

## `Shlgr[ep][!]`

## `Shnew[!]`, `Shvne[w][!]`, `Shtabnew[!]`, `Shne[w][!]`

With a bang use the existing buffer

## `P`

- `P !` example
- The `P` command started as a  `B` the [vis](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1195).
